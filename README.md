# PGA-Metis-Project
This is the first individual project that I completed at Metis.  Motivation was to see if I could use Linear Regression to predict a player's earnings using data found on the official PGA website as well as physical attribute data from Newsday.  After obtaining the data, I ran different models and analyses with traditional stats, only shots-gained stats, and all stats combined.
